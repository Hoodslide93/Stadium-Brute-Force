DESCRIPTION : This python program serves as a macro to brute-force the Stadium locked room for its user. It can input a combination in 0.2 seconds. The program can be started, paused, resumed and ended at will.


HOW TO USE : Input 1 or 2 codes, with the symbols as "C" (China), "N" (Nose) or "H" (House).

To brute-force from a single code, enter an empty field in the second input.

EXAMPLE: 

- code 1: nnnhh123 
- code 2:


If the input is valid, the macro will start giving out combinations in groups of 6. 

- To get the next group of codes, press "enter" in the console.


NOTES: 

   -The input is case-insensitive.

   -The program will check the validity of the inputs, so you don't have to worry about making a mistake.

Enjoy!
